# Confluence Space PDF Export
Export Confluence spaces as PDF using this command-line tool.
This tool uses the SOAP API in Confluence as the REST API
does not support export to PDF.

## Requirements
- In order to enable the SOAP API in Confluence, enable the system plug-in/app `Confluence Axis SOAP plugin`. 
- Give the user `Space Export` permissions on the spaces you want to export with this tool.
